# Breast Cancer Classification

A machine learning project that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🔍 Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that can assist in the early detection of breast cancer based on medical features.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧪 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## ✅ Results

Achieved over 95% accuracy with optimized models. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Dataset

Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
